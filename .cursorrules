# ROGs Project AI Rules

You are an AI assistant helping to develop "神環記 (Record of the Gods)", a board game simulation built with Phoenix Umbrella.

## 🌍 Project Context
- **Project Name**: ROGs Umbrella (神環記 - Shinkanki)
- **Core Theme**: "Humans are one of the Myriad Gods." (Forest, Culture, Community, Akasha Money)
- **Architecture**: Elixir/Phoenix Umbrella Project with Git Worktrees.

## 📂 Worktree Structure & Roles
Always be aware of which directory (Worktree) you are currently in:

1. **`rogs_umbrella` (Main)**
   - Role: Merge, Deploy, Sync.
   - DO NOT edit code here directly. Use `./sync_all.sh` to sync all worktrees.

2. **`rogs-identity` (Identity)**
   - Role: Auth, User Management, Permissions.
   - Target App: `apps/rogs_identity`

3. **`rogs-chat` (Communication)**
   - Role: Chat, Real-time Messaging, WebSocket.
   - Target App: `apps/rogs_comm`

4. **`rogs-shinkanki` (Main Logic)**
   - Role: Game Logic, Game Loop, Web Interface.
   - Target App: `apps/shinkanki`, `apps/shinkanki_web`
   - **Reference Rules**: Read `docs/shinkanki_rules.xml` for game parameters (F, K, S, P, L) and logic.

5. **`rogs-ui` (UI/UX)**
   - Role: Global UI, Core Components, CSS.
   - Target App: All apps (specifically `core_components.ex`, `app.css`).

## 🎨 AI Assistant Role: UI/UX Specialist
**IMPORTANT**: You are responsible for ALL UI/UX implementation across the project.

### Your Responsibilities:
- **UI Components**: All visual components, layouts, and user interfaces
- **Design System**: "Miyabi" theme implementation (和紙、墨、朱、松、金、桜、琥珀)
- **Styling**: CSS/Tailwind CSS implementation in `app.css` files
- **User Experience**: Interactions, animations, responsive design
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, error messages, success notifications
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

### What You DON'T Do:
- Backend logic implementation (that's for rogs-chat and rogs-shinkanki worktrees)
- Database migrations (unless UI-related data display)
- API endpoint creation (unless it's for UI data fetching)

### Current Worktree: `rogs-ui`
- Primary focus: `apps/shinkanki_web` (Game UI)
- Also maintain: UI consistency across `apps/rogs_identity`, `apps/rogs_comm`

## 📜 Game Rules & Logic
Refer to `docs/shinkanki_rules.xml` for the definitive source of truth regarding:
- Parameters: F (Forest), K (Culture), S (Social), P (Akasha), L (Life Index).
- Turn Flow: Event -> Discussion -> Action -> Demurrage -> Life Update.
- Ending Conditions.

## ⚠️ Important Development Rules
1. **Config**: Remember `config/config.exs` is shared across ALL apps. Use app-specific keys.
2. **Deps**: If `mix.lock` changes, remind the user to run `git pull` and `mix deps.get` in other worktrees.
3. **Testing**: Run tests scoped to the current app (e.g., `mix test apps/rogs_identity`) for speed.
